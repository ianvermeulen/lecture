## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
  - Time = T_start + (students/numRows)/CountingSpeed + T_gatherCounts + T_arithmetic

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
  - Time = TotalStudents/CountingSpeed

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
  - The class should be big enough that the time difference between counting one row and counting the entire class is bigger than the amount of time spend starting the process, gathering the counts, and doing the final arithemetic.
