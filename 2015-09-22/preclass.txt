0.  How much time did you spend on this pre-class exercise, and when?

1.  What are one or two points that you found least clear in the
    9/22 slide decks (including the narration)?

2.  The pthread_mc.c file in the demo subdirectory runs a Monte Carlo
    simulation to estimate the expected value of a uniform random
    variable.  The "-p" option sets the number of processors used,
    while "-b" sets the number of trials between synchronizations.

    a) Write a model for the run time for this simulation code in
       terms of the number of trials (N), number of processors (p),
       time per trial (t_trial), and time to update the global
       counters in the critical section (t_update).

       Run Time = (N/p)*t_trial + t_update*(N/batch_size)


    b) Run the code with a few different parameter values in order
       to estimate N, t_trial, and t_update for this code on
       a totient compute node.

       N is about 1000000
       t_trial is about 7.02 ns
       t_update is about 0.25 ns


    c) Based on your model, suggest a strategy for choosing the batch
       size.  How might you generalize this strategy to automatically
       choose batch sizes for different types of computational
       experiments?

       From the simple, naive model suggested, increasing the batch size
       basically always reduce run time. However, the batch size shouldn't
       be so large that too many simulations are run. So the batch_size could
       be set at N/p so each thread can run one batch and then have each
       update the global counters. This will work if the number of trials
       that need to run are known, otherwise using a smaller batch size
       would be better so only enough trials to obatin the desired amount
       of error.       

    
3.  In the workq subdirectory of this directory, there is a basic work
    queue implementation.  Following the strategy outlined in the
    slides, add synchronization calls in the locations marked TODO.
    You should run the code to make sure it behaves as expected!
