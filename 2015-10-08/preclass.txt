0.  How much time did you spend on this pre-class exercise, and when?

1.  What are one or two points that you found least clear in the
    10/08 slide decks (including the narration)?

      Include some use cases for the scatter/gather, All-to-All, etc.
      schemes.

2.  Now that we are now basically a third of the way into the
    semester, and are (mostly) settled into the steady pace of things,
    I would appreciate your feedback on what is working well or poorly
    about the class.  Comments on things I can reasonably change are
    particularly useful -- venting about the cluster, for example, is
    understandable but doesn't help me that much in adjusting!

      Lectures are a little slow paced. The student picker was a good
      idea but seems to be wasting a lot of time in class when no one
      answers.

3.  The ring demo implements the protocol described in the particle
    systems slide deck from 9/15:

    a) In your own words, describe what ring.c is doing.

        it is sending data through a ring network of buffers and measuring
        how much communicaiton occurs.

    b) How might you modify the code to have the same computational
       pattern, but using non-blocking communication rather than
       MPI_Sendrecv?  Note that according to the MPI standard,
       one isn't supposed to read from a buffer that is being
       handled by a non-blocking send, so it is probably necessary
       to use three temporary buffers rather than the current two.
